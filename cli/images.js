/**
 * BUILD-TIME RESPONSIVE IMAGE GENERATION.
 *
 * Every raster image in public/ gets a 320/640/1024/1920 WebP ladder and a
 * tiny LQIP, written next to the build output and uploaded to the edge by the
 * same scanner that ships the rest of public/. The app reads the manifest this
 * emits and hands the ladder to <DashImage>, which is the only thing that ever
 * makes it emit a srcset.
 *
 *   WHY THIS RUNS HERE AND NOT ON THE SERVER
 *
 * The client SDK asks the API to do this (POST media/generate-variants), but
 * that endpoint only ever walks the MEDIA LIBRARY. A file committed to public/
 * is not in the library — it is copied to the CDN verbatim — so no amount of
 * server-side work will ever touch it. Platforms keep most of their art in
 * public/, which is exactly why nothing was being generated.
 *
 * Doing it locally also means no upload round-trip, no queue to wait on, and
 * no backend endpoint to ship first. The heavy work happens once per changed
 * file on the machine already running the build.
 *
 *   NEVER UPSCALE
 *
 * A width is only emitted when the source is at least that wide, plus the
 * source's own width as the top rung. Upscaling invents pixels, costs bytes,
 * and makes the largest srcset candidate a worse image than the original.
 *
 *   THE CACHE IS KEYED ON CONTENT
 *
 * `_gen/.cache.json` maps a source path to the sha256 it was generated from.
 * Re-running with nothing changed does no work. Change one image and only that
 * image is re-encoded — which matters when a platform has 88 of them.

 *
 * <DashImage> has to resolve a bare `src` against the manifest, and it is used
 * in both Server and Client Components across seven sites. That rules out a
 * React context (dead in a Server Component), a module-level setter called
 * from a root layout (never runs in the client bundle), and runtime fetching
 * (a network round-trip to learn the size of an image you are already
 * rendering). What is left is a static import the bundler can inline into
 * whichever graph needs it — and the SDK cannot import a file out of the app,
 * so the app's data has to come to the SDK.
 *
 * The alternative was editing the same adapter in seven separate repos and
 * keeping them in step forever. This way a site gets responsive images by
 * reinstalling, with no diff of its own.
 *
 * SAFE BECAUSE IT IS A BUILD ARTIFACT, NOT STATE. It is rewritten on every
 * `localplug images`/`localplug build`, which run BEFORE `next build`, so the
 * bundler always reads a file this build wrote. A checked-in default of `{}`
 * ships with the package, so the import resolves in a fresh clone that has
 * never run the generator, and every unknown path simply falls back to the
 * original file.
